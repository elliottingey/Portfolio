    <h1>Learning JavaScript</h1>

    <p> To begin with learning JavaScript, I found a tutorial at <a href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a>. They gave a good overview
    about the basics of JavaScript from what I went through. The site is broken up into sections of which I read through the first two parts (1.1-2.18). This 
    should be a good future reference if I have any issues with JavaScript or TypeScript.</p>

      <h3>React and TypeScript</h3>
      
      <p> After the professor showed off React in class, I tried to install it and get it running. Being able to make changes and have them update in real time
        seems super cool and useful. Unfortionaly, I could not get it to work properly. I'm not sure why, but I was running into a bunch of issues. I will be trying
        to debug my problems and get it running as soon as I can.</p3>
