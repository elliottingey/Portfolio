    <h3>9/23/21 - painful errors</h3>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>Spent about 4 hours trying to get React running and properly using github pages. I was getting a ton of weird errors and ran into problems with git. I had to manually delete the github_pages folder in .cache for some reason. I ended up with a working page but I didnt finish the project I was planning on doing with the react page.</li>
        <li>Now have git correctly set up to push updates to my repository. I also have a remote branch for my react project to have updates sent through. Now that I know the process and the solutions to the errors I was running into, it should be easier to make react sites for the projects I want to finish next week. </li
        <li></li>

          Learned a lot of it from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">https://www.w3schools.com</a>. 
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/">This</a> was helpful for Bootstrap,
          and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">this</a> was helpful for CSS.</li>
        <li>Figured out how to make and edit my theme</li>

        <li>Rearranged and Organized my portfolio files</li>
        <li>Made a navigation bar fixed to top of every page. This is in

        <li>Added dropdown menu to some pages to see version history. See bottom of <a href="https://elliottingey.github.io/Portfolio/htmltestingWeek2">this page</a>

        <li>Used Bootstrap to make <a href="https://elliottingey.github.io/Portfolio/home">home page</a> less ugly. Now, the projects exist in clickable boxes with
            a title and some basic info about them.</li>
        <li>Updated my original <a href="https://elliottingey.github.io/Portfolio/htmltestingWeek2">html project</a> a little. I fixed the picture and added some
            explanation text about it. I also added a couple paragraphs about bootstrap.</li>

    <h3>9/14/21 - Custom Theme 2</h3>
    <p>Found the <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/slate">github pages theme repository</a> that I am using. 
    I also found someone having the same issues that I was. Ill copy over files from the repository that I want to edit and
    that should fix it.</p>

    <h3>9/13/21 - Custom Theme</h3>
    <p>Gave myself a headache trying to make my site less ugly. I was trying to fix the header but I was fighting with
    the Jekyll theme I had installed. Figured out a work around or two, but it was time consuming and not ideal.</p>

    <h3>9/11/21 - JavaScript Tutorial</h3>
    <p>Began Looking into JavaScript. I used a website I found called <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/">javascript.info</a>.
     They had a great explination of the basics of JavaScript. I talk about it a little more
      <a href="https://elliottingey.github.io/Portfolio/learningJavaScriptWeek2">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>9/9/21 - Bootstrap and Portfolio Setup</h3>
    <p>Added basic portfolio functionality and began learning bootstrap to help some of the CSS headaches I was going through. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/">w3schools</a> again since I liked their CSS tutorials. After reading that for a while, I applied some of the knowledge to make containers and grouped buttons for the portfolio website. Some examples of bootstrap can be seen in the source code for this changelog<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elliottingey/Portfolio/main/changelog.md"> here.</a> My portfolio now has links to my inital html project and its code, as well as links to my TODO and changelog. I also added functionality to return to the home page of the portfolio site. It is still pretty ugly, so my next goal is proabably to clean up the looks a bit. I also wrote out the changelog and TODO list today. </p>

    <h3>9/8/21 - CSS tutorial</h3>
    <p> I felt fairly comfortable with HTML at a base level after the previous day, so I moved onto trying to learn basic CSS. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/">w3schools</a> and started reading up on how to create buttons and dropdown menus. My eventual plan being to add a drop down menu on applicable pages with every change that is specific to that project. Below is the source code to a simple button and dropdown with code changed slightly from the tutorial site. There is no github page containing this code since it is just a test file.</p>

  <h3>9/7/21 - HTML tutorial</h3>
  <p>I followed an html tutorial on marksheet.io. At the end, I used what I had learned to make a basic HTML site.
  The tutorial, my site, and the source code are linked below.</p>
  <p> NOTE: I had a steep learning curve and a lot of issues with the intial github pages setup so some of the timestamps on github for file uploads and edits may not be accurate. Not Sure. </p>
