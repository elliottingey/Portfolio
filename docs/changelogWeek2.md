    <h3>9/9/21 - Bootstrap and Portfolio Setup</h3>
    <p>Added basic portfolio functionality and began learning bootstrap to help some of the CSS headaches I was going through. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/">w3schools</a> again since I liked their CSS tutorials. After reading that for a while, I applied some of the knowledge to make containers and grouped buttons for the portfolio website. Some examples of bootstrap can be seen in the source code for this changelog<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elliottingey/Portfolio/main/changelog.md"> here.</a> My portfolio now has links to my inital html project and its code, as well as links to my TODO and changelog. I also added functionality to return to the home page of the portfolio site. It is still pretty ugly, so my next goal is proabably to clean up the looks a bit. I also wrote out the changelog and TODO list today.

    <h3>9/8/21 - CSS tutorial</h3>
    <p> I felt fairly comfortable with HTML at a base level after the previous day, so I moved onto trying to learn basic CSS. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/">w3schools</a> and started reading up on how to create buttons and dropdown menus. My eventual plan being to add a drop down menu on applicable pages with every change that is specific to that project. Below is the source code to a simple button and dropdown with code changed slightly from the tutorial site. There is no github page containing this code since it is just a test file.</p>

  <h3>9/7/21 - HTML tutorial</h3>
  <p>I followed an html tutorial on marksheet.io. At the end, I used what I had learned to make a basic HTML site.
  The tutorial, my site, and the source code are linked below.</p>
  <p> NOTE: I had a steep learning curve and a lot of issues with the intial github pages setup so some of the timestamps on github for file uploads and edits may not be accurate. Not Sure. </p>

    <h3>9/2/21 - github pages setup</h3>
  <p>I made a github pages and fought with the setup. Over the next few days, I got it working correctly and configured in the ways I could figure out. I added a theme provided  by github. </p>
