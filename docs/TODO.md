  <h1>TODO List:</h1>
    <h2>General:</h2>
      <ul>- Continue to update look and design of Portfolio as I learn more</ul>
      <ul>- Add functionality to show change over time for projects in portfolio</ul>
      <ul>- Learn How to create a hoverable dropdown that will show relevant changelog for which page you are on</ul>
      <ul>- Fix changelog so that the text columns are lined up and/or arranged nicer</ul>
      <ul>- Begin learning JavaScript</ul>
      <ul>- Fix code layout in general. Lots of the spacing is pretty bad and hard to read</ul>
  
  <h2>Basic HTML site:</h2>
  <ul>- find a way to have dog image resize based on the screen size looking at site. I would imagine the solution is bootstrap from what I learned today, but I am not sure</ul>
  
  <h2> CSS and Bootstrap:</h2>
  <ul>- Continue learning how to best use these in website design</ul>
  <ul>- Make a dropdown menu that can display information (such as a change log)</ul>
  <ul>- Display relevant changes in a log depending on where this dropdown menu is on the site</ul>
  <ul>- Add a more useable and complex site navigation menu. Currently, there is only a home button</ul>
