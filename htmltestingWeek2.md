<h1>I didn't realize that a webpage was just a text file</h1>
<h5>By: Elliot Tingey</h5>
  <h6> Last Updated 9/7/21</h6>
<p>I was starting my Portfolio by using the <strong>MarkSheet.io tutorials</strong>
when I found something pretty surprising. I did not realize that there was such
thing as an html file. I was even more surprised to learn that internet browsers
opened and used those files. I knew that CSS could be used in html, but I
had assumed that the html code itself was being run on something else and not just opened in
  html files.</p>


<h3>What else I Learned from MarkSheet</h3>

<p>In this file, I have used a couple of html elements I learned from <a>MarkSheet.io</a>. These include
<ul><strong>- </strong>unordered lists</ul><ul><strong>- </strong>articles</ul><ul><strong>- </strong>paragraphs</ul><ul><strong>- </strong>headers</ul><ul><strong>- </strong>url address tags</ul><ul><strong>- </strong>"strong" words</ul>
I have also learned that I should mark my document with the proper header so that
the browser uses the standard html 5. I learned some standard html formatting and
how to insert an image as well.</p>		


<h4>This is a (now properly sized) Dog Image</h4>
<p> Note: I tried figuring out how to resize the image to the page. I am confused and it
didnt work after I tried a few things, so I gave up for now. The dog is very
cute if you zoom out though. I personally recommend it.</p>
